        <h1>Thinking about ThinkPads</h1>
        <p>
            ThinkPads have been the black laptops ubiquitous at the workplace, coffeeshops, and at schools. Although less known than
            their counterparts made by Apple, the ThinkPad laptop has been the top choice of mobile personal computing before
            MacBooks made their debut. Thinkpads were previously made by IBM, but the torch of perfecting these reliable
            and reliably stunning machines has been handed off to Lenovo.

        <h2>Why get a ThinkPad?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Maintainable - Many ThinkPad parts and documentation are readily available. ThinkPads are known for their ability
                to be serviced by a user.</li>
            <li>Upgradable - ThinkPads are easily serviceable, meaning that users can easily replace parts such as adding a larger
                and faster hard drive or adding RAM.</li>
            <li>Variety - ThinkPads come in many shapes, sizes, and color too (silver ThinkPads were recently released)! With
                many ThinkPad series from mobility, 2-in-1, to performance, there's a ThinkPad to suit any need.</li>
        </ul>
